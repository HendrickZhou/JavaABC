1. 
Q: List the size (number of bits used for representation) and maximum value for each of the following wrapper types: Short, Integer, Long and Double. Read the documentation for information on how to get these values.

A:Members like MAX_VALUE and SIZE which will tell the answer.
short	2 bytes	32,767
int		4 bytes	2,147,483, 647
long	8 bytes	9,223,372,036,854,775,807
double	8 bytes	approximately 1.79769313486231570E+308

2. 
Q:What kind of problem would you run into with the following code and why?

Double dObj = null;

double d = dObj;

A:java.lang.NullPointerException.
dObj is a object which accept null but d is a primitive double so assigning a null doesn't make sense.

3. 
Q:Give suitable examples of data collections for each collection classes: LinkedList, ArrayList, and HashMap.

A:LinkedList:adjacent table for graph.
ArrayList:Just array
HashMap:some table with mapping relationship between a key and a value

4. 
Q:Name some collection class implementations that you would like to see included with the JDK.

A:LinkedList and HashMap
I wonder how java implement pointer here?
