README for module 5 assignment

1. Answer for part 1 is written in pt1_answer.html for the sake of convenience.

2.The optimal amount of code I can think up:
First of all the classes have to override the method in interface. So at least 5 individual `getWeightInPounds()` methods have to appear.
Secondly I can define the weight in the level of Vehicle Automobile and LargeAutomobile. This may increase the code amount compared with defining the weight of individual cars, but I really perfer doing like this.

3.Main routine for part 2 assume there're 2 parking garage. The cars will be randomly generated. If the first garage is full, then the second garage will be activated.
